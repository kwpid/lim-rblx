# Roblox Crate Opening Game - Project Documentation

## üéÆ Game Overview
This is a Roblox crate/case opening game where players can roll for random items based on a weighted probability system. Items have different rarities determined by their value, and some items can be limited stock with serial numbers.

## üìã Current Game Features

### 1. Item System
- **Item Properties:**
  - RobloxId: The Roblox asset ID for the item thumbnail
  - Name: Display name of the item
  - Value: The Robux value (determines rarity and roll chance)
  - Rarity: Auto-calculated from value (8 tiers)
  - Stock: Optional limited quantity (0 = unlimited, 1-100 = stock item)
  - CurrentStock: Tracks how many have been rolled
  - SerialNumber: For stock items (e.g., #1/50)

### 2. Rarity System (8 Tiers)
Items are automatically assigned rarity based on their value:
- **Common**: 1 - 2,499 Robux (Gray)
- **Uncommon**: 2,500 - 9,999 Robux (Green)
- **Rare**: 10,000 - 49,999 Robux (Blue)
- **Ultra Rare**: 50,000 - 250,999 Robux (Purple)
- **Epic**: 250,000 - 750,000 Robux (Orange)
- **Ultra Epic**: 750,000 - 2,500,000 Robux (Red-Orange)
- **Mythic**: 2,500,000 - 9,999,999 Robux (Red)
- **Insane**: 10,000,000+ Robux (Magenta)

### 3. Probability System
- Higher value items = lower chance to win
- Uses inverse probability weighting
- Formula: Chance = (1/ItemValue) / TotalInverseValue
- Example: A 1,000 Robux item is 10x more likely than a 10,000 Robux item

### 4. Crate Opening Mechanics
- **Roll Cost**: FREE (currently set to 0)
- **Roll Time**: 5 seconds animation
- **Animation**: Scrolling items with chosen item landing in view
- **Stock Protection**: If a stock item sells out during animation, automatically rerolls
- Players can only roll one crate at a time

### 5. Admin System
- **Whitelisted Admins**: Defined by User ID in AdminConfig.lua
  - Current Admin ID: 1547280148
- **Admin Panel Features:**
  - Create new items with Roblox ID, name, value, and optional stock
  - Live preview of item thumbnail
  - Auto-fills item name from Roblox marketplace
  - Input validation for all fields
- **Console Commands:**
  - `CheckDatabase()` - View all items sorted by value
  - `CheckRarities()` - View item count by rarity tier

### 6. Data Persistence (DataStore)
- **Player Data Saved:**
  - Inventory (all owned items)
  - Cases Opened count
  - Cash (currently unused but tracked)
- **Item Database:**
  - All available items stored globally
  - Shared across all players
  - Persists between server restarts
- **Save Intervals:**
  - Auto-save every 2 minutes
  - Save on player leave
  - Save on server shutdown

### 7. Inventory System
- **Display Features:**
  - Shows all owned items with thumbnails
  - Color-coded by rarity
  - Shows serial numbers for stock items
  - Shows quantity for stackable items
  - Search bar for filtering
  - Click to view detailed item info
- **Item Stacking:**
  - Regular items stack (shows "3x", "5x", etc.)
  - Stock items never stack (each has unique serial number)

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure Explained

### ReplicatedStorage/
Contains modules shared between client and server:
- **ItemRarityModule.lua**: Determines rarity from value, calculates roll percentages

### ServerScriptService/
Server-side game logic:
- **AdminConfig.lua**: Admin user whitelist and permission checking
- **AdminItemHandler.lua**: Handles admin item creation requests, sets up RemoteEvents
- **CratesServer.lua**: Core crate opening logic, weighted random selection, stock management
- **DataStoreAPI.lua**: Public API for other scripts to modify player data
- **DataStoreManager.lua**: Low-level DataStore save/load operations
- **ItemDatabase.lua**: Global item database, stores all available items
- **PlayerDataHandler.lua**: Manages player join/leave, creates leaderstats, auto-save

### StarterGUI/
Client-side UI scripts:
- **AdminGUI.lua**: Admin panel for creating items (LocalScript)
- **CratesClient.lua**: Crate opening animation and UI (LocalScript)
- **InventorySystem.lua**: Inventory display and management (LocalScript)

## üîß How Systems Connect

### Item Creation Flow:
1. Admin opens admin panel (AdminGUI.lua)
2. Admin enters item details and clicks "Create"
3. Client fires CreateItemEvent to server (AdminItemHandler.lua)
4. Server validates admin status and item data
5. ItemDatabase adds item and saves to DataStore
6. Server confirms success back to client

### Crate Opening Flow:
1. Player clicks Roll button (CratesClient.lua)
2. Client fires RollCrateEvent to server (CratesServer.lua)
3. Server gets rollable items from ItemDatabase
4. Server picks random item using weighted probability
5. Server generates animation items and sends to client
6. Client plays 5-second scrolling animation
7. Server waits 5 seconds then awards item
8. Server checks stock and claims serial number if needed
9. Server adds item to player inventory via DataStoreAPI
10. Server increments cases opened counter

### Inventory Update Flow:
1. Server adds item to player data (DataStoreAPI.lua)
2. Item either stacks (regular) or adds unique entry (stock)
3. Client requests inventory via GetInventoryFunction
4. Server returns player's inventory array
5. Client displays items with thumbnails and info

## üìä Data Structures

### Player Data (DataStore):
```lua
{
  Inventory = {
    -- Regular item (stackable):
    {RobloxId = 12345, Name = "Item", Value = 1000, Rarity = "Common", Amount = 3, ObtainedAt = timestamp},
    -- Stock item (unique):
    {RobloxId = 67890, Name = "Rare Item", Value = 50000, Rarity = "Ultra Rare", SerialNumber = 5, ObtainedAt = timestamp}
  },
  CasesOpened = 10,
  Cash = 0
}
```

### Item Database Entry:
```lua
{
  RobloxId = 12345,
  Name = "Cool Item",
  Value = 25000,
  Rarity = "Uncommon",
  Stock = 50,          -- 0 = unlimited, 1-100 = limited
  CurrentStock = 12,   -- How many claimed so far
  CreatedAt = timestamp
}
```

## üéØ What the User Wants

**Current State:**
- Core game mechanics are implemented and functional
- User cannot test in Roblox Studio (using Replit Agent instead)
- User will test and provide feedback on fixes/features

**Development Process:**
1. User tests in Roblox
2. User reports bugs or requests features
3. Agent makes code changes
4. Repeat until game is complete

**User's Testing Responsibilities:**
- Testing all game functionality
- Reporting bugs with details
- Requesting new features or changes
- Providing Roblox-specific feedback (UI, UX, gameplay)

## üöÄ Important Technical Notes

### RemoteEvents Setup:
All client-server communication uses RemoteEvents in ReplicatedStorage/RemoteEvents/:
- `CreateItemEvent` - Admin item creation
- `CheckAdminFunction` - Check if player is admin
- `RollCrateEvent` - Request crate roll
- `CrateOpenedEvent` - Send animation data to client
- `GetInventoryFunction` - Fetch player inventory
- `InventoryUpdatedEvent` - Notify client of inventory changes

### Stock Item Logic:
- Stock items have limited quantity (1-100)
- Each rolled stock item gets unique serial number
- Once CurrentStock >= Stock, item becomes unrollable
- Race condition protection: claims serial during server wait
- If stock sells out during animation, automatically rerolls different item

### Global Variables:
- `_G.PlayerData` - Active player data in memory (PlayerDataHandler.lua)
- `_G.CheckDatabase()` - Console command to view all items
- `_G.CheckRarities()` - Console command to view rarity breakdown

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. Cash system exists but is not currently used
2. No trading system yet
3. No item deletion/selling system yet
4. Admin panel is client-side GUI (needs to be placed in correct ScreenGui)
5. Inventory UI needs ScreenGui with specific structure
6. Crate opening UI needs ScreenGui with specific structure

## üìù Future Development Areas

Based on the code structure, potential features to add:
- Item selling system (convert items to cash)
- Trading between players
- Different crate types with different item pools
- Daily rewards system
- Leaderboards for most valuable inventory
- Item gifting system
- VIP/gamepass benefits
- Economy system using cash
- Item showcase/display system
