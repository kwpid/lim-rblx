# Roblox Crate Opening Game - Project Documentation

## üéÆ Game Overview
This is a Roblox crate/case opening game where players can roll for random items based on a weighted probability system. Items have different rarities determined by their value, and some items can be limited stock with serial numbers.

## üìã Current Game Features

### 1. Item System
- **Item Properties:**
  - RobloxId: The Roblox asset ID for the item thumbnail
  - Name: Display name of the item
  - Value: The Robux value (determines rarity and roll chance)
  - Rarity: Auto-calculated from value (8 tiers)
  - Stock: Optional limited quantity (0 = unlimited, 1-100 = stock item)
  - CurrentStock: Tracks how many have been rolled
  - SerialNumber: For stock items (e.g., #1/50)

### 2. Rarity System (8 Tiers)
Items are automatically assigned rarity based on their value:
- **Common**: 1 - 2,499 Robux (Gray)
- **Uncommon**: 2,500 - 9,999 Robux (Green)
- **Rare**: 10,000 - 49,999 Robux (Blue)
- **Ultra Rare**: 50,000 - 250,999 Robux (Purple)
- **Epic**: 250,000 - 750,000 Robux (Orange)
- **Ultra Epic**: 750,000 - 2,500,000 Robux (Red-Orange)
- **Mythic**: 2,500,000 - 9,999,999 Robux (Red)
- **Insane**: 10,000,000+ Robux (Magenta)

### 3. Probability System
- Higher value items = lower chance to win
- Uses inverse probability weighting with power of 0.75
- Formula: Chance = (1/ItemValue^0.75) / TotalInverseValue
- Balanced scaling ensures rare items are still obtainable while maintaining rarity

### 4. Crate Opening Mechanics
- **Roll Cost**: FREE (currently set to 0)
- **Roll Time**: 5 seconds animation (2 seconds with Fast Roll gamepass)
- **Animation**: Scrolling items with chosen item landing in view
- **Stock Protection**: If a stock item sells out during animation, automatically rerolls
- **Chat Notifications**: 
  - Items worth 250k+ Robux: Colored chat message to the player
  - Items worth 5M+ Robux: Global announcement to entire server
  - Shows item name, value (formatted), serial # (for stock items), color-coded by rarity
- Players can only roll one crate at a time

### 5. Admin System
- **Whitelisted Admins**: Defined by User ID in AdminConfig.lua
  - Current Admin ID: 1547280148
- **Admin Panel Features:**
  - **Create Items**: Create new items with Roblox ID, name, value, and optional stock
    - Live preview of item thumbnail
    - Auto-fills item name from Roblox marketplace
    - Input validation for all fields
  - **Give Items to Players**: Give items directly to players
    - Enter item Roblox ID, amount to give, and player ID/username
    - Supports both User ID (number) and username (case-insensitive)
    - Regular items: Gives specified amount, properly increments owner count
    - Stock items not at max: Gives next available serial number (as if rolled)
    - Stock items at max: Automatically increases stock limit by 1, gives new serial
    - Only works for players currently in the game
- **Console Commands:**
  - `CheckDatabase()` - View all items sorted by value
  - `CheckRarities()` - View item count by rarity tier

### 6. Data Persistence (DataStore)
- **Player Data Saved:**
  - Inventory (all owned items)
  - Rolls (total number of crates opened)
  - Cash (currently unused but tracked)
  - InvValue (total inventory value, automatically calculated)
- **Item Database:**
  - All available items stored globally
  - Shared across all players
  - Persists between server restarts
- **Save Intervals:**
  - Auto-save every 2 minutes
  - Save on player leave
  - Save on server shutdown

### 7. Inventory System
- **Display Features:**
  - Shows all owned items with thumbnails
  - **Sorting**: Equipped items first, then highest value to lowest value
  - Color-coded by rarity
  - Shows serial numbers for stock items
  - Shows quantity for stackable items
  - Stock items: Shows "X / Y copies" (serials claimed / total stock)
  - Regular items: Shows "X owners" (unique players who own it)
  - Search bar for filtering
  - Click to view detailed item info
- **Item Stacking:**
  - Regular items stack (shows "3x", "5x", etc.)
  - Stock items never stack (each has unique serial number)
- **Inventory Value Tracking:**
  - Automatically calculates total inventory value
  - Includes stacked items (Value √ó Amount)
  - Updates in real-time when items are added/removed
  - Displayed in leaderstats as "InvValue"

### 8. Owner Tracking System
- **Unique Ownership:**
  - Tracks how many unique players own each item globally
  - Regular items: +1 owner only when a NEW player gets the item
  - Stock items: +1 owner for each unique stock item acquired
  - Displayed as "copies: X" in inventory UI
- **Smart Counting:**
  - If player already has a regular item and gets it again, it stacks (no owner increment)
  - Stock items always count as new owners since each serial is unique
  - Shows true rarity based on how many players actually own the item

### 9. Equipped Item Persistence
- **Auto-Equip System:**
  - Equipped items are saved to player data in EquippedItems array
  - When player rejoins, all previously equipped items automatically equip to their character
  - Items equip when character spawns or respawns
  - Supports accessories, hats, tools, and head items
- **Head Item Support:**
  - Head items replace the player's existing head when equipped
  - When unequipped, the default Roblox head is restored with a default face
  - Properly handles neck Motor6D connections for head replacement
  - Works seamlessly with character respawns and auto-equip on rejoin
- **Failsafe Protection:**
  - System checks if player still owns each equipped item before equipping
  - Items that are no longer owned are removed from EquippedItems
  - Prevents errors from trying to equip items player no longer has
- **Client-Server Sync:**
  - Client syncs equipped items from server on inventory load
  - Equip button correctly shows "Unequip" for already-equipped items
  - GetEquippedItemsFunction RemoteFunction provides server data to client

### 10. Notification System
- **Notification Types:**
  - EQUIP: Shows when player equips an item
  - UNEQUIP: Shows when player unequips an item
  - SELL: Shows when player sells item(s) with cash earned
  - DATA_LOADED: "Welcome Back!" when data loads successfully
  - DATA_ERROR: Error message if data fails to load
  - GIFT: When admin creates new item (all players notified)
  - ERROR, VICTORY: Pre-existing notification types
- **Notification Features:**
  - Shows item thumbnail image for equip/unequip/sell notifications
  - Displays cash earned for sell notifications
  - 2-second delay on data load notifications to ensure client is ready
  - Queued system handles multiple notifications gracefully

### 11. Index System (All Items Catalog)
- **Display All Game Items:**
  - Shows every item in the game database (not just player's inventory)
  - Sorted by value (highest first), then rarity, then name
  - Displays item thumbnail, name, value, rarity, and owner count
  - Search/filter functionality to find specific items
- **Item Detail Panel:**
  - ItemName: Display name of the selected item
  - TotalOwners: Shows how many unique players own this item
  - Value: Robux value of the item
- **Owner List (Stock Items Only):**
  - Shows scrolling list of all players who own each serial number
  - Each entry displays:
    - PlayerPFP: Player's avatar headshot
    - @Username: Player's username prefixed with @
    - #SerialNumber: Serial number prefixed with #
  - Sorted by serial number (lowest first: #1, #2, #3, etc.)
  - Works even when players are offline (data stored in ItemDatabase)
- **Serial Owner Tracking:**
  - SerialOwners array in ItemDatabase tracks {UserId, SerialNumber, Username}
  - Automatically recorded when stock items are rolled or admin-given
  - GetItemOwnersFunction RemoteFunction provides data to client
  - RecordSerialOwner() called by DataStoreAPI when adding stock items
  - Data persists across sessions in DataStore

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure Explained

### ReplicatedStorage/
Contains modules shared between client and server:
- **ItemRarityModule.lua**: Determines rarity from value, calculates roll percentages

### ServerScriptService/
Server-side game logic:
- **AdminConfig.lua**: Admin user whitelist and permission checking
- **AdminItemHandler.lua**: Handles admin item creation requests, sets up RemoteEvents
- **CratesServer.lua**: Core crate opening logic, weighted random selection, stock management
- **DataStoreAPI.lua**: Public API for other scripts to modify player data
- **DataStoreManager.lua**: Low-level DataStore save/load operations
- **ItemDatabase.lua**: Global item database, stores all available items
- **PlayerDataHandler.lua**: Manages player join/leave, creates leaderstats, auto-save

### StarterGUI/
Client-side UI scripts:
- **AdminGUI.lua**: Admin panel for creating items (LocalScript)
- **CratesClient.lua**: Crate opening animation and UI (LocalScript)
- **InventorySystem.lua**: Inventory display and management (LocalScript)

## üîß How Systems Connect

### Item Creation Flow:
1. Admin opens admin panel (AdminGUI.lua)
2. Admin enters item details and clicks "Create"
3. Client fires CreateItemEvent to server (AdminItemHandler.lua)
4. Server validates admin status and item data
5. ItemDatabase adds item and saves to DataStore
6. Server confirms success back to client

### Crate Opening Flow:
1. Player clicks Roll button (CratesClient.lua)
2. Client fires RollCrateEvent to server (CratesServer.lua)
3. Server gets rollable items from ItemDatabase
4. Server picks random item using weighted probability
5. Server generates animation items and sends to client
6. Client plays 5-second scrolling animation
7. Server waits 5 seconds then awards item
8. Server checks stock and claims serial number if needed
9. Server adds item to player inventory via DataStoreAPI
10. Server increments rolls counter

### Inventory Update Flow:
1. Server adds item to player data (DataStoreAPI.lua)
2. Item either stacks (regular) or adds unique entry (stock)
3. Server recalculates total inventory value automatically
4. Server updates leaderstats InvValue
5. Server fires InventoryUpdatedEvent to notify client
6. Client requests inventory via GetInventoryFunction
7. Server returns player's inventory array
8. Client displays items with thumbnails and info

## üìä Data Structures

### Player Data (DataStore):
```lua
{
  Inventory = {
    -- Regular item (stackable):
    {RobloxId = 12345, Name = "Item", Value = 1000, Rarity = "Common", Amount = 3, ObtainedAt = timestamp},
    -- Stock item (unique):
    {RobloxId = 67890, Name = "Rare Item", Value = 50000, Rarity = "Ultra Rare", SerialNumber = 5, ObtainedAt = timestamp}
  },
  Rolls = 10,        -- Total number of crates opened
  Cash = 0,
  InvValue = 53000,  -- Auto-calculated: (1000 √ó 3) + (50000 √ó 1)
  EquippedItems = {12345, 67890},  -- Array of RobloxIds of equipped items
  DataVersion = "DataVersion.15"
}
```

### Item Database Entry:
```lua
{
  RobloxId = 12345,
  Name = "Cool Item",
  Value = 25000,
  Rarity = "Uncommon",
  Stock = 50,          -- 0 = unlimited, 1-100 = limited
  CurrentStock = 12,   -- How many claimed so far
  Owners = 8,          -- How many unique players own this item
  CreatedAt = timestamp
}
```

## üéØ What the User Wants

**Current State:**
- Core game mechanics are implemented and functional
- User cannot test in Roblox Studio (using Replit Agent instead)
- User will test and provide feedback on fixes/features

**Development Process:**
1. User tests in Roblox
2. User reports bugs or requests features
3. Agent makes code changes
4. Repeat until game is complete

**User's Testing Responsibilities:**
- Testing all game functionality
- Reporting bugs with details
- Requesting new features or changes
- Providing Roblox-specific feedback (UI, UX, gameplay)

## üöÄ Important Technical Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Studio API Access Setup
**Before testing in Roblox Studio, you MUST enable DataStore access:**

1. Open your game in Roblox Studio
2. Go to **Game Settings** (Home tab ‚Üí Game Settings)
3. Navigate to **Security** tab
4. Enable **"Studio Access to API Services"**
5. Click **Save**

**Without this setting:**
- ‚ùå Leaderstats will not appear on players
- ‚ùå Inventory will not load or display items
- ‚ùå Player data won't save between sessions
- ‚ùå You'll see DataStore error messages in output

**The scripts will now show helpful error messages if this isn't enabled!**

### RemoteEvents Setup:
All client-server communication uses RemoteEvents in ReplicatedStorage/RemoteEvents/:
- `CreateItemEvent` - Admin item creation
- `CheckAdminFunction` - Check if player is admin
- `RollCrateEvent` - Request crate roll
- `CrateOpenedEvent` - Send animation data to client
- `GetInventoryFunction` - Fetch player inventory
- `InventoryUpdatedEvent` - Notify client of inventory changes

### Stock Item Logic:
- Stock items have limited quantity (1-100)
- Each rolled stock item gets unique serial number
- Once CurrentStock >= Stock, item becomes unrollable
- Race condition protection: claims serial during server wait
- If stock sells out during animation, automatically rerolls different item

### Global Variables:
- `_G.PlayerData` - Active player data in memory (PlayerDataHandler.lua)
- `_G.CheckDatabase()` - Console command to view all items
- `_G.CheckRarities()` - Console command to view rarity breakdown

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. Cash system exists but is not currently used
2. No item deletion/selling system yet (selling system exists, but no admin deletion)
3. Admin panel is client-side GUI (needs to be placed in correct ScreenGui)
4. Inventory UI needs ScreenGui with specific structure
5. Crate opening UI needs ScreenGui with specific structure

## üìù Future Development Areas

Based on the code structure, potential features to add:
- Different crate types with different item pools
- Daily rewards system
- Leaderboards for most valuable inventory
- Item gifting system
- VIP/gamepass benefits
- Economy system using cash
- Item showcase/display system
