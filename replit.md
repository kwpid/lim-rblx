# Project Memory

## Overview
This is a **Roblox crate opening/unboxing game** with weighted probability item rolls, admin tools, data persistence, and inventory management. Players roll crates to win items of varying rarities based on their Robux values.

## Project Type
- **Platform**: Roblox
- **Language**: Lua
- **Genre**: Case Opening / Unboxing Game
- **Data Storage**: Roblox DataStore Service

## Core Game Systems

### Item System
- Items have Roblox asset IDs, names, values, and rarities
- 8-tier rarity system (Common ‚Üí Insane) based on value
- Support for both regular items (stackable) and stock items (limited with serial numbers)
- Weighted probability: higher value = lower chance

### Crate Opening
- Free rolls with 5-second animation
- Weighted random selection based on item value
- Stock item protection with automatic reroll
- Visual scrolling animation with item previews
- Item names color-coded by rarity in animation
- Serial numbers displayed when winning stock items (e.g., "You won: Egg (#1)")
- Continue button always shows after every roll

### Admin Tools
- Whitelisted admin system (User ID: 1547280148)
- Admin panel GUI for creating items
- Live item preview using Roblox thumbnails
- Notification system: All players receive "New Item" notification when admin creates an item
- Console commands: `CheckDatabase()` and `CheckRarities()`

### Data Persistence
- Player inventory with automatic stacking
- Cases opened counter
- Cash system (earned from selling items)
- Inventory value (InvValue) - auto-calculated total value
- Auto-save every 2 minutes
- DataStore versions: ItemDatabase_v1, PlayerData_v1
- Data version system: Change DATA_VERSION in both DataStoreManager.lua AND ItemDatabase.lua to wipe all player data AND reset stock/serial numbers (e.g., "DataVersion.10" ‚Üí "DataVersion.11")

### Inventory Display
- Shows all owned items with thumbnails and rarity colors
- Serial numbers for stock items
- Displays "copies: X / Y exist" for stock items (X = unique owners, Y = total stock)
- Displays "copies: X" for regular items (X = unique owners)
- Search/filter functionality
- Click to view detailed item info

### Equipping Items
- Players can equip items from their inventory to their character
- Equip/Unequip button in inventory detail panel
- Button text changes to "Unequip" when item is equipped
- Click again to unequip and remove from character
- Equipped items are visible to all players (server-side)
- Uses item's Roblox asset ID to load and attach to character
- Works with accessories, hats, and tools
- Items are tagged with OriginalRobloxId for precise unequipping

### Selling Items
- **Sell buttons hidden for stock items** (to prevent breaking limited items)
- **Confirmation required**: Button shows "Are you sure?" on first click
  - Click again within 3 seconds to confirm
  - Automatically resets if not confirmed
  - Resets when selecting a different item
- **Sell**: Sell a single copy of an item for 80% of its value (regular items only)
  - Regular items: Decreases stack count, or removes if only 1 left
  - Players who sell all copies have their owner count decremented
- **Sell All**: Sell all copies of an item at once (regular items only)
  - Calculates total value of all copies and gives 80% cash back
  - Removes all matching items from inventory
- Cash is added to player's wallet after selling
- Inventory value updates automatically after selling

## Important Setup Requirements

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Studio API Access (REQUIRED)
Before testing in Roblox Studio, you **must** enable DataStore access:
1. Game Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Enable "Studio Access to API Services"
2. Without this, leaderstats and inventory will not work

The scripts now include detailed error messages to help diagnose this issue.

## User Preferences
- User will test the game in Roblox and provide feedback
- Agent cannot test in Roblox, so user is responsible for testing
- Iterative development: User tests ‚Üí Reports bugs/requests ‚Üí Agent implements ‚Üí Repeat
- User wants a living documentation file that tracks game details

## Development Workflow
1. User tests game in Roblox Studio
2. User reports bugs, issues, or feature requests
3. Agent updates Lua scripts based on feedback
4. Agent updates PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md to reflect changes
5. Repeat until game is complete

## Important Notes
- All client-server communication uses RemoteEvents in ReplicatedStorage/RemoteEvents/
- Stock items (1-100) get unique serial numbers when rolled
- Regular items (stock = 0) stack in inventory
- Admin panel and inventory UIs require specific ScreenGui structure in Roblox
- DataStore is used for both player data and global item database
- Inventory value is automatically recalculated whenever items are added/removed
- GetInventoryFunction RemoteFunction allows clients to fetch inventory data
- GetAllItemsFunction RemoteFunction allows clients to fetch all items in the game
- InventoryUpdatedEvent notifies clients when inventory changes
- EquipItemEvent, SellItemEvent, SellAllItemEvent handle inventory item interactions
- Selling stock items restores their availability in the item pool (decrements CurrentStock)
- Cash system is now active - players earn cash by selling items (80% of value)

## Current Project Status
