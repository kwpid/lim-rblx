# Roblox Game Project Structure

This project contains the standard folder structure for Roblox game development.

## Folder Structure

### 📁 Workspace
Contains game objects, models, and parts that exist in the game world.

### 📁 ReplicatedStorage
Holds resources that need to be accessed by both the server and clients (scripts, modules, assets).

### 📁 ServerScriptService
Contains server-side scripts that handle game logic, data management, and server operations.

### 📁 ServerStorage
Stores server-only assets and objects that clients don't need to access directly.

### 📁 StarterGUI
Contains UI elements and GUI components that players see when they join the game.

## Getting Started

The folder structure is now set up and ready for development. You can start adding your scripts, models, and UI components to the appropriate folders.
